## Outline

**Intro**

+ A couple months ago I wanted to make a better slider
+ 
+ What's going is Physics

**Why Physics**

+ Because we're monkeys
+ You don't always need physics
+ Using a mouse is like holding a pen. The mouse and the pen are both tools of precision. You don't really feel the weight of either when you are using them.
+ Using your hands is like turning a page of the book. It's a general motion. You expect the object to move like its in the real world
+ Practical UI physics. It's Practical â€” so you can understand it

**Flickity demo**

+ flick
+ flick & release -> goes back to origin
+ Big flick -> moves several slides
+ free scroll

**Basic principles**

+ flow chart. It's all about position. Position is changed by velocity. Velocity is changed by friction and forces. Friction slows down velocity. Forces can both slow down and speed up velocity.
+ position
+ velocity. Show velocity animation
+ friction. Show friction animation

**Basic demo**

drag

**Forces**

wind

attraction

**More forces**

conditional attraction

rubber band bounds

photo scroller

## To do

Draggable element

Draggable element with attraction
